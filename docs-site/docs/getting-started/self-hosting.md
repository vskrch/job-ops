The easiest way to run JobOps is via Docker Compose. The app is self-configuring and guides you through setup on first launch.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine + Compose v2

## 1) Start the stack

No environment variables are required to boot:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This pulls the pre-built image from GHCR and starts the API, UI, and scrapers in one container.

To build locally instead:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

## 2) Access the app and onboard

Open:

- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3005`

The onboarding wizard helps you validate and save:

1. **LLM Provider**: OpenRouter by default (or OpenAI/Gemini/local URL).
2. **PDF Export**: RxResume credentials, plus your preferred PDF renderer in Settings.
3. **Template Resume**: Choose a base resume from your RxResume account.

Settings are saved to the local database.

## Gmail OAuth (Tracking Inbox)

If you want Gmail integration, configure OAuth credentials.

### 1) Create Google OAuth credentials

In Google Cloud:

1. Configure OAuth consent screen.
2. Enable Gmail API.
3. Create OAuth client ID (`Web application`).
4. Add redirect URI:
  - `http://localhost:3005/oauth/gmail/callback`
  - Or your production URL, for example `https://your-domain.com/oauth/gmail/callback`

### 2) Configure environment variables

- `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (required)
- `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (required)
- `GMAIL_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` (optional, recommended in production)

### 3) Restart and connect

- Restart container
- Open Tracking Inbox and click **Connect Gmail**

For a full step-by-step setup, exact scope requirements, and troubleshooting, see:

```

## Persistent data

`./data` bind-mount stores:

- SQLite DB: `data/jobs.db`
- Generated PDFs: `data/pdfs/`

## Logging

JobOps writes structured JSON logs to stdout only — no log files, no rotation.

- Default level is `debug` (full verbose output: HTTP requests, SQL queries, pipeline steps, per-job work, LLM calls, visa sponsor fetches).
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=info`, `LOG_LEVEL=warn`, or `LOG_LEVEL=error` to reduce noise. `LOG_LEVEL=verbose` is an alias for `debug`.
- Every log line includes a timestamp, level, message, and available context (`requestId`, `pipelineRunId`, `jobId`).

## Public demo mode

Set `DEMO_MODE=true` for sandbox deployments.

Behavior in demo mode:

- Works locally: browsing/filtering/status/timeline edits
- Simulated: pipeline run/summarize/process/rescore/pdf/apply
- Blocked: settings writes, DB clear, backups
- Auto-reset: every 6 hours

## Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Self-hosted Reactive Resume

If you self-host Reactive Resume, set:

- `RXRESUME_URL=http://rxresume.local.net`
- `RXRESUME_MODE=auto` (recommended) or `v5`/`v4` to force a specific API version
- `RXRESUME_API_KEY=...` (or configure `rxresumeApiKey` in JobOps Settings)

`auto` mode is the default and prefers v5 when an API key is configured, then falls back to v4 credentials.

## Local LaTeX PDF rendering

JobOps supports 2 PDF renderers:

- `rxresume`: export the final PDF through RxResume
- `latex`: render locally from tailored resume data using LaTeX and `tectonic`

When using the LaTeX renderer:

- The Docker image installs `tectonic` for you.
- For non-Docker local runs, install `tectonic` yourself and optionally set `TECTONIC_BIN` if it is not on your `PATH`.

RxResume remains the source of truth for base resume data, project visibility, and tailoring inputs in both modes.
