## What it is

This guide explains how to add a new country's visa sponsor register that is auto-discovered by the orchestrator at startup.

Each provider is a directory under `visa-sponsor-providers/` containing a `manifest.ts` file. The manifest owns only what is country-specific: fetching and parsing the upstream register. Storage, scheduling, caching, and search are handled by the shared service layer.

Provider ids must be registered in `shared/src/visa-sponsor-providers/index.ts` to be accepted at runtime.

## Why it exists

Without a manifest contract, adding a new country's register required touching multiple orchestrator files.

With the provider system, contributors only need to:

1. Add a manifest in `visa-sponsor-providers/<id>/`.
2. Register the new id in the shared catalog.

The service layer handles everything else.

## How to use it

1. Create a directory under `visa-sponsor-providers/<id>/` where `<id>` is a short lowercase slug (e.g. `au`, `ca`).
2. Add a `manifest.ts` in that directory (or `src/manifest.ts`).
3. Export a manifest that satisfies `VisaSponsorProviderManifest`:
   - `id` — matches the directory name and the catalog entry
   - `displayName` — human-readable country name
   - `countryKey` — lowercase country string compatible with `normalizeCountryKey()` (e.g. `"australia"`)
   - `scheduledUpdateHour` (optional) — UTC hour for the daily refresh; defaults to `2`
   - `fetchSponsors()` — fetches the upstream source and returns `VisaSponsor[]`; throws on failure
4. Add the new id to `shared/src/visa-sponsor-providers/index.ts`:
   - append to `VISA_SPONSOR_PROVIDER_IDS`
   - add an entry in `VISA_SPONSOR_PROVIDER_METADATA`
5. Start the server and confirm the startup log reports the provider in the registry.
6. Run the full CI checks.

Example manifest:

```ts
import type {
  VisaSponsor,
  VisaSponsorProviderManifest,
} from "../../shared/src/types/visa-sponsors";

export const manifest: VisaSponsorProviderManifest = {
  id: "au",
  displayName: "Australia",
  countryKey: "australia",
  scheduledUpdateHour: 3,

  async fetchSponsors(): Promise<VisaSponsor[]> {
    // Fetch and parse the upstream register here.
    // Return an array of VisaSponsor objects.
    // Throw on failure — the service layer handles error state.
    return [];
  },
};

export default manifest;
```

Example catalog update in `shared/src/visa-sponsor-providers/index.ts`:

```ts
export const VISA_SPONSOR_PROVIDER_IDS = ["uk", "us", "ca"] as const;

export const VISA_SPONSOR_PROVIDER_METADATA = {
  uk: { label: "United Kingdom", countryKey: "united kingdom" },
  us: { label: "United States", countryKey: "united states" },
  ca: { label: "Canada", countryKey: "canada" },
};
```

## Common problems

### Provider not registered at startup

- Check the file path: valid locations are `visa-sponsor-providers/<id>/manifest.ts` or `visa-sponsor-providers/<id>/src/manifest.ts`.
- Ensure the file exports `default` or a named `manifest`.
- Check startup logs for registry warnings such as skipped invalid manifests, duplicate ids, duplicate country keys, or ids missing from the shared catalog.

### Provider id rejected at runtime

- The id must be in `VISA_SPONSOR_PROVIDER_IDS` in `shared/src/visa-sponsor-providers/index.ts`.
- Duplicate ids or duplicate `countryKey` values are skipped with a warning.

### Provider loads but returns no sponsors

- Verify `fetchSponsors()` returns a non-empty array and does not silently swallow errors.
- Check `GET /api/visa-sponsors/status` for the provider's error field.
- Trigger a manual refresh with `POST /api/visa-sponsors/update/<id>` and watch server logs.

### countryKey does not match job locations

- The `countryKey` must produce the same output as `normalizeCountryKey()` when called on job location strings.
- Use lowercase, no diacritics, matching the canonical country name used in job data.

### Upstream changed its file name or format

- Upstream sources occasionally rename files or change column layouts. The manifests for `us` and `ca` are written to tolerate this: the US provider discovers the latest annual file from the USCIS archive page, and the Canada provider picks the newest quarter from the open.canada.ca API and maps columns by header name rather than position.
- If a provider still fails, check the error message on `GET /api/visa-sponsors/status` and update the manifest's link pattern or parser.

### A country has no official register

- Some countries (e.g. India) do not publish an official employer register for work visas. Do not add a provider that scrapes unofficial or paid lists; document the gap instead.
