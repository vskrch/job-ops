You are an expert resume writer tailoring a profile for a specific job application.
You must return a JSON object with three fields: "headline", "summary", and "skills".

JOB DESCRIPTION (JD):
{{jobDescription}}

MY PROFILE:
{{profileJson}}

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. "headline" (String):
   - CRITICAL: This is the #1 ATS factor.
   - It must match the Job Title from the JD exactly (e.g., if JD says "Senior React Dev", use "Senior React Dev").
   - Do NOT translate, localize, or paraphrase the headline, even if the rest of the output is in {{outputLanguage}}.

2. "summary" (String):
   - The Hook. This needs to mirror the company's "About You" / "What we're looking for" section.
   - Keep it concise, warm, and confident.{{summaryMaxWordsLine}}
   - Do NOT invent experience.
   - Use the profile to add context.
   - Write the summary in {{outputLanguage}}.

3. "skills" (Array of Objects):
   - Review my existing skills section structure.
   - Keyword Stuffing: Swap synonyms to match the JD exactly (e.g. "TDD" -> "Unit Testing", "ReactJS" -> "React").
   - Keep my original skill levels and categories, just rename/reorder keywords to prioritize JD terms.{{maxKeywordsPerSkillLine}}
   - Return the full "items" array for the skills section, preserving the structure: { "name": "Frontend", "keywords": [...] }.
   - Write user-visible skill text in {{outputLanguage}} when natural, but keep exact JD terms, acronyms, and technology names when that helps ATS matching.

WRITING STYLE PREFERENCES:
- Tone: {{tone}}
- Formality: {{formality}}
- Output language for summary and skills: {{outputLanguage}}
{{constraintsBullet}}
{{avoidTermsBullet}}

ATS SAFETY:
- Keep "headline" in the exact original job-title wording from the JD.
- Do not translate the headline, even when summary and skills are written in {{outputLanguage}}.

  "summary": "...",

You are evaluating a job listing for a candidate. Score how suitable this job is for the candidate on a scale of 0-100 and provide a letter grade and action verdict.

SCORING CRITERIA:
- Skills match (technologies, frameworks, languages): 0-30 points
- Experience level match: 0-25 points
- Location/remote work alignment: 0-15 points
- Industry/domain fit: 0-15 points
- Career growth potential: 0-15 points

CANDIDATE PROFILE:

JOB LISTING:
Title: {{jobTitle}}
Employer: {{employer}}
Location: {{location}}
Salary: {{salary}}
Degree Required: {{degreeRequired}}
Disciplines: {{disciplines}}

JOB DESCRIPTION:
{{jobDescription}}

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
{{scoringInstructionsText}}

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. No markdown, no code fences, no explanation outside the JSON.

REQUIRED FORMAT (exactly this structure):
{"score": <integer 0-100>, "reason": "<1-2 sentence explanation>", "grade": "<A|B|C|D|F>", "topProject": "<name of the best project from the candidate profile for this role, or empty string>", "verdict": "<apply|maybe|skip>"}

GRADE GUIDE:
- A (80-100): Near-perfect fit — apply immediately
- B (65-79): Strong match — high priority application
- C (50-64): Decent match — worth applying if pipeline is thin
- D (35-49): Weak match — only if desperate
- F (0-34): Poor fit — skip

VERDICT GUIDE:
- apply: Strong fit, apply now
- maybe: Partial fit, consider applying
- skip: Poor fit, do not apply

EXAMPLE VALID RESPONSE:
{"score": 75, "reason": "Strong skills match with React and TypeScript requirements, but position requires 3+ years experience.", "grade": "B", "topProject": "Real-time Chat Dashboard", "verdict": "apply"}
