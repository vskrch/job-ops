Stop applying blind.

Scrapes major job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor & more), AI-scores suitability, tailors resumes, and generates PDFs with a built-in LaTeX exporter, and tracks application emails automatically.

You still apply to every job yourself. JobOps just finds jobs, makes sure you're applying to the right ones with a tailored CV, and not losing track of where you're at.

Self-hosted. Docker-based.

## Documentation (Start Here)

JobOps ships with full docs for setup, architecture, extractors, and troubleshooting.

If you want the serious view of the project, start here:

- [Documentation Home](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/)
- [Self-Hosting Guide](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/getting-started/self-hosting)
- [Feature Overview](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/features/overview)
- [Orchestrator Pipeline](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/features/orchestrator)
- [Extractor System](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/extractors/overview)
- [Troubleshooting](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/troubleshooting/common-problems)

## Quick Start (10 Min)

Prefer guided setup? Follow the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/getting-started/self-hosting).

```bash
# 1. Download
git clone https://github.com/DaKheera47/job-ops.git
cd job-ops

# 2. Start (Pulls pre-built image)
docker compose up -d

# 3. Launch Dashboard
# Open http://localhost:3005 to start the onboarding wizard

```

### Deploy to Heroku

```bash
# Requires the Heroku CLI and a container-stack app (heroku.yml included).
heroku create your-app --stack container
heroku config:set SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" NODE_ENV=production
git push heroku main
```

- The container bundles the built-in LaTeX PDF exporter (Tectonic), Playwright/Python sources, and a production client build.
- Set `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET` (Cloudflare R2 or any S3-compatible store) for durable database backups across dyno restarts.
- `USAJOBS_API_KEY` enables the US federal job source; set LLM keys in **Settings → Environment & Accounts**.
